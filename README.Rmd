# clbart

The goal of `clbart` is to estimate heterogeneous effects of a primary exposure in a case-only design. Specifically, this method is appropriate for data which have been constructed using the \emph{case-crossover} design, such that only one case exists within each strata. The effect of the primary exposure is modeled as a function of time-invariant covariates using Bayesian additive regression trees.

## Installation

You can install the development version of `clbart` from [GitHub](https://github.com/) with:

``` r
# install.packages("devtools")
devtools::install_github("jacobenglert/clbart")
```

## Example
For a detailed example of how to use the package and fit `clbart` models, view the package vignette [here](https://github.com/jacobenglert/clbart/vignettes/clbart.pdf).
